# Crud-App

A modern Product Management (CRUD) system built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.
This project was developed as a home assignment and demonstrates a clean SPA architecture, user-friendly UI, and clear separation of concerns.

## Overview

This app lets you manage a list of products (Fruits, Vegetables, and Field Crops): add, edit, delete, filter, and search products easily. The UI is responsive and pleasant, with strong typing and organized client-side logic.

## Main Features

- **Product list display** with search and category filtering
- **Add new product** (with zod validation)
- **Edit existing product**
- **Delete one or multiple products** (with Undo option by event-bus)
- **Confirmation modals** for sensitive actions
- **Global alert system** for feedback messages
- **Loading spinner** for async actions
- **Responsive, clean design (Sass)**

## Product Model

Each product includes the following fields:
- `name` â€“ Product name (required)
- `sku` â€“ Unique identifier (number between 0 and 1000)
- `description` â€“ Description (optional)
- `category` â€“ Category: Fruit / Vegetable / Field Crop
- `marketingDate` â€“ Marketing date (must be at least 7 days ago)
- `isDeleted` â€“ Soft delete flag (internal use)
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt` â€“ Creation/update timestamps
